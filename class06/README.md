## Announcements

1. There was an error in the previously posted version of Question 8 in the [Lab 2 instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2023/blob/main/lab02/lab02.pdf), which now read (changes in bold):

> By now, we'd like you to have read through Chapter 3 of David Spiegelhalter's *The Art of Statistics*. In **questions 6 and 7, we broadly examined** the relationship between county metropolitan status and **the COVID mortality rate. Earlier**, we limited this analysis to just counties in 5 midwestern states. Reflecting on Chapter 3 of *The Art of Statistics*, please write a brief essay (100-150 words) that discusses the process of inductive inference and how that influences the conclusions we can draw from our work in this assignment. As always, use complete and clear English sentences in your essay.
