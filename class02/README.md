## Today's Opener: The Quick Survey

As you come in, you will receive a paper survey with 15 questions. Please read these instructions carefully before writing anything down.

1. Introduce yourself to someone near you.
2. Record the survey answers **for that other person**, while they record your responses.
3. Be sure to complete all 15 questions (both sides of the paper).
4. When you are finished, thank your partner and raise your hand. Someone will come around to collect your survey.

There is a [PDF copy of the Quick Survey here](431_surveyhandout_1perstudent_2023-08-31.pdf), if you'd like to look at the form after your paper copy has been collected.

## Announcements

1. Since I wasn't able to record Class 01, I created a summary video (12-13 minutes long) which you can watch, listen to, or download by visiting [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu) then selecting **Zoom**, then **Cloud Recordings** and selecting the recording entitled **431: Class 01 Summary (for 2023-08-29)**.
2. We're making every effort to record today's and all subsequent classes in their entirety, which will be posted (in theory) to the same place on [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu).
3. Thank you to Kamilla Abdurakhmanov, David Askew, Julia Joo, Kelsey Lewis, Ethan Martin, Samir Memic, Vern Olaker, Gazi Samita and Reina Samuel for serving as recorders for their groups in the Photo Age Guess Activity in Class 01. I appreciate it.
4. TA Office Hours will begin on Tuesday 2023-09-05. Our Shared Google Drive (431 Fall 2023 Dr Love and Students) contains Zoom links for these sessions in a document called **TA office hours schedule and Zoom links**.
5. If you're one of the two or three people who hasn't done so yet, please complete the [Welcome to 431 Survey](https://bit.ly/431-2023-welcome-survey) today. Remember that you must be logged into Google via your CWRU account to do so. Thanks to those of you who've already completed the survey. 
6. Seven of you still need to sign up for the [Campuswire discussion forum](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2023/campuswire.html).

## Things to Do This Weekend

1. Read through the [Course Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-syllabus-2022/).
    - Hint: I'll know on **Tuesday at 9 AM** if you've done this. Thanks to the 14 of you who have.
2. By Tuesday's class, we're hoping you will read the introduction and Chapter 1 of Spiegelhalter's *The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data* as well as sections 1-3 of [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/).
3. Bookmark the [main course website](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2023/), and the books [R for Data Science, 2nd ed.](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), the [R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org/), and perhaps [OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/book/os/). I would also bookmark the [Posit Cheat Sheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/) page.
4. [Install the software](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2023/software.html) and [R packages, data and code](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2023/software.html#installing-r-packages-and-datacode-for-431) you'll need.
5. Take a look at the following items:
    - the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2023/calendar.html), to see what's ahead of you
    - the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/) (where I would try to skim from the start through Chapter 3),
    - and at your first substantial assignment: [Lab 01 (due 2023-09-12)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2023).
6. **Ask us questions**. TA office hours start Tuesday, but [Campuswire is available now](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/campuswire.html).
