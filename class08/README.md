## Three Last Things

*Nature* has a series of articles from its Points of Significance column gathered under the general heading of [Statistics for biologists](https://www.nature.com/collections/qghhqm/pointsofsignificance) that were recommended to me by a past student, and which I think are really nicely done. Let me call your attention today to:

- [Visualizing samples with box plots](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2813), by Martin Krzywinski & Naomi Altman from 2014
- [Importance of being uncertain](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2613) also by Krzywinski & Altman from 2013
- [Simple linear regression](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3627) by Altman & Krzywinski from 2015
