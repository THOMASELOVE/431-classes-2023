## Announcements

1. A Quiz 1 answer sketch including results is [available on our Shared Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lLVFE5f2oPByAo1W_0Yw4qVjX2siMlFz/view?usp=drive_link).
    - Emails went out Wednesday 2023-10-11 to all students describing their individual results. If you didn't get the email, contact Dr. Love.
    - If you didn't do as well as you would have liked, my best advice is to review what went wrong so you improve your understanding, then focus on Project A.
2. Also, it's never too early to start working on [Lab X](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-labX/).
3. Feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 13 [is now available](https://bit.ly/431-2023-min-13-feedback).
    - Minute Paper grades are posted to the 431 Grades Roster on our Shared Drive.
4. [Lab 4](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2023/blob/main/lab04/lab04.pdf) was revised (specifically, **shortened**) on 2023-10-11 by Dr. Love. Please make sure you do [the current version](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2023/blob/main/lab04/lab04.pdf), dated 2023-10-11, which has **5** questions instead of 6.
    - If you've already done the lab, don't worry, since I just eliminated the old Question 6, and I will add that question to one of the later Labs, while Questions 1-5 are the same as they were before, just with different allotments of points.

## Project A Proposal Status

Project A Proposal Status information [is available here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2023/blob/main/projA/projectA_proposal.md).

- A problem lots of people had (which I mostly didn't mention, but will look for more closely in the portfolios) is that in the codebook (Section 11) you need to specify the years when the data were actually collected by County Health Rankings for your chosen outcome and predictor variables. Look [here for those details](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/explore-health-rankings/county-health-rankings-measures).
- Another suggestion, in advance of doing your analyses... try to get through the whole Project A without using the word "significant". The reasons why will be clearer after next Thursday's class.

## Sample Analyses related to Project A

I built examples of studies *similar to* Project A [Analysis 1](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/431-movies-analysis1.html), [Analysis 2](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/431-movies-analysis2.html), and [Analysis 3](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/431-movies-analysis3.html), but using [the Favorite Movies data](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2023/tree/main/movies). 

- Sample Analysis 1 (simple regression): [View Analysis 1 HTML](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/431-movies-analysis1.html), and [Download Analysis 1 code (qmd)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data/main/data-and-code/431-movies-analysis1.qmd)
- Sample Analysis 2 (independent samples): [View Analysis 2 HTML](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/431-movies-analysis2.html), and [Download Analysis 2 code (qmd)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data/main/data-and-code/431-movies-analysis2.qmd)
- Sample Analysis 3 (paired samples): [View Analysis 3 HTML](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/431-movies-analysis3.html), and [Download Analysis 3 code (qmd)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data/main/data-and-code/431-movies-analysis3.qmd)
- You'll also find these materials linked on our [Project A Examples](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/examples.html) page.

I wrote these documents to help you get a feel for what we are looking for in the [Analyses for Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/analyses.html), and to make the scope of that work a bit clearer. The documents are *suggestive*, but definitely **not prescriptive** (as opposed to the [Proposal material](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/proposal.html) which was and is mostly prescriptive.)

- Use **your own** words, not mine, in preparing your analytic work for Project A. Thanks.
- More importantly, use your judgment to decide what to include in your Project A portfolio regarding these issues.
- Remember that [more isn't better](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/portfolio.html#hint-more-isnt-better.), as I wrote in the Project A instructions.

## What to work on this weekend

1. [Lab 4](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2023/blob/main/lab04/lab04.pdf) (now with just **5** questions) is due next Tuesday, 2023-10-17 at noon.
2. Project A proposal (if necessary) and once that is approved, [Project A analyses](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/analyses.html).
    - Note that Project A is due Tuesday 2023-10-31 at noon.
3. Read *The Art of Statistics* through Chapter 8.
4. In anticipation of next Thursday's session, you might want to skim through:
    - [Statistical Inference in the 21st Century: A World Beyond p < 0.05](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/toc/utas20/73/sup1) from 2019 in *The American Statistician*
    - The American Statistical Association’s 2016 [Statement on p-Values: Context, Process and Purpose](http://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108).
6. It's never too early to start working on [Lab X](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-labX/).

## One Last Thing

"[How to Do Bad Biomarker Research](https://hbiostat.org/blog/post/badb/)" by Frank Harrell is an October 2022 blog post which...

> covers some of the bad statistical practices that have crept into biomarker research, including setting the bar too low for demonstrating that biomarker information is new, believing that winning biomarkers are really “winners”, and improper use of continuous variables. Step-by-step guidance is given for ensuring that a biomarker analysis is not reproducible and does not provide clinically useful information.

If you're interested in the subject, I encourage you to take a look.
