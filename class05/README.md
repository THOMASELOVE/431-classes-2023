## Announcements

1. There is a Minute Paper after Class 05, due Wednesday 2023-09-13 at Noon. Please complete it, on time.
2. An answer sketch (including grading rubric) for [Lab 01](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2023) will be posted before class on Thursday to our Shared Google Drive. 
    - Labs that are turned in 1-12 hours after the deadline will lose 10% of available points, while Labs turned in more than 12 but less than 48 hours after the deadline will lose 30% of available points. Labs turned in more than 48 hours after the deadline will receive no credit, since by then the Lab Sketch will be posted.
    - Grades and the videos you developed for Question 1 should be available next Tuesday 2023-09-19.
3. Remember that [Lab 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2023) is due on Tuesday 2023-09-19 at Noon. For that Lab, you will have to do some coding in R. Use what we're doing this week (and what we did last week) to help.

## Project A - time to get started

Detailed [instructions for Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/) are now available at <https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/>.

- Project A is the first of two real data science projects you’ll be doing this semester. In Project A, you’ll each work with part of the [County Health Rankings 2023](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/explore-health-rankings/rankings-data-documentation) data. 
- You can *and should* get started on the [Data](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/data.html) and [Proposal](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/proposal.html) materials now. All of that work must be completed in September. The [Analyses](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/analyses.html) and [Portfolio](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/portfolio.html) will be done in October.
- Note that Dr. Love has provided you with several [examples and tips for Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/examples.html) to help you get started.
- You can work alone, or with one other person on Project A. If you work as a pair, you create one project together, and each of you receive the same grade.
    - We'll set aside some time in Thursday's Class 06 to let you chat with others and decide if you might like to work as partners.
- Detailed instructions for [Project B](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/) will be posted later this semester, but I wouldn't think about that now. Project A is a September/October activity. Project B is a November/December activity.
  
## Today's materials

Today (and Thursday), we will work with the `dm_431.csv` data set, which is now available [on our 431-data page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data), and also in [the data subfolder for this README](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2023/tree/main/class05/data).

- Today's slides use some material from [Allison Horst's Stats Illustrations](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations).
