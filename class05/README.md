## Announcements

1. There is a [Minute Paper after Class 05](https://bit.ly/431-2023-minute-5), due Wednesday 2023-09-13 at Noon. Please complete it, on time.
2. TAs will check all submitted Lab 1 work between now and noon tomorrow. If we don't find your video, your Quarto file and your HTML file, or if you've submitted a faulty HTML file (usually this is because you left `embed-resources: true` out of the YAML at the start of your Quarto file) we'll inform you, and ask you to resubmit. When resubmitting to Canvas, please post everything again - it's just easier on the TAs. Don't worry if Canvas adds a number to the filename at the end of your submission.
3. If someone answers a question on Campuswire that is useful to you, hit the little up arrow next to the answer. This is how those things float to the top of the discussion.
4. An answer sketch (including grading rubric) for [Lab 01](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2023) will be posted before class on Thursday to our Shared Google Drive. 
    - Labs that are turned in 1-12 hours after the deadline lose 10% of available points, while Labs turned in more than 12 but less than 48 hours after the deadline lose 30% of available points. Labs turned in more than 48 hours after the deadline will receive no credit, since by then the Lab Sketch will be posted.
    - Grades and the videos you developed for Question 1 should be available next Tuesday 2023-09-19.
5. Remember that [Lab 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2023) is due on Tuesday 2023-09-19 at Noon. For that Lab, you will have to do some coding in R. Use what we're doing this week (and what we did last week) to help.
6. This doesn't matter now, but at the end of the semester, I've changed the time for submitting the final Project B materials on the Calendar to 9 AM on 2023-12-18, instead of noon. Sorry, but I need the extra few hours to review the work and get your grades in on time.

## Project A - time to get started

Detailed [instructions for Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/) are now available at <https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/>.

- Project A is the first of two real data science projects you’ll be doing this semester. In Project A, you’ll each work with part of the [County Health Rankings 2023](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/explore-health-rankings/rankings-data-documentation) data. 
- You can *and should* get started on the [Data](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/data.html) and [Proposal](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/proposal.html) materials now. All of that work must be completed in September. The [Analyses](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/analyses.html) and [Portfolio](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/portfolio.html) will be done in October.
- I have provided several [examples for Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/examples.html) to help you get started.
- You can work alone, or with one other person on Project A. If you work as a pair, you create one project together, and each of you receive the same grade.
    - We'll set aside some time in Thursday's Class 06 to let you chat with others and decide if you might like to work as partners.
- Detailed instructions for [Project B](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/) will be posted later this semester, but I wouldn't think about that now. Project A is a September/October activity. Project B is a November/December activity.
  
## Today's materials

Today (and Thursday), we will work with the `dm_431.csv` data set, which is now available [on our 431-data page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data), and also in [the data subfolder for this README](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2023/tree/main/class05/data).

- Today's slides use some material from [Allison Horst's Stats Illustrations](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations).
