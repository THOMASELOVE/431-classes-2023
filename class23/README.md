## Announcements

1. The Project B Schedule of Presentations [is available here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2023/blob/main/projB/schedule.md). Plan to join the Zoom call (or arrive at my office) five minutes before your presentation begins.
2. I asked two of our students, Liz Stanley and Julia Joo, if I could share their excellent videos submitted as part of 431 Project A. They have each consented to let me do this, for which I am grateful. I thought this might be of interest to those of you looking to improve your communications skills, or just looking for examples of a strong presentation. Each of their videos are now posted to our Shared Drive, in the *Project A Examples* ... *Videos* subfolder. Please feel free to view them at your leisure.
3. Quiz 2 materials are starting to become available, and all of the materials will be posted by 5 PM on Thursday 2023-11-30. Visit <https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-quizzes-2023/tree/main/quiz2>. Quiz 2 is due Tuesday 2023-12-05 at Noon.
