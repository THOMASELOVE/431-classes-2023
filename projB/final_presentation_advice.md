# Project B Presentation Reminders

If anything disastrous occurs before your presentation, or if you have questions, email me after Monday. TA office hours are open Monday as is Campuswire, then closed for the rest of the semester.

Show up five minutes early. If you're working with a partner, one of you should be prepared to share your screen and run the presentation, while each of you talks.

You can do this. Most people are more worried before they start than after they finish, I promise.

1. I will keep track of time during the presentation and let you know when I want you to move on.

**Study 1 (6-8 minutes)**

2. I will start by asking you to tell me which of the five possible analyses in Study 1 you skipped. Options are: (a) Paired Samples (b) Independent Samples (c) ANOVA, (d) 2x2 table, (e) JxK table
3. Next, I will ask which one of your four completed Study 1 parts you would like to present.
4. After that, I will tell you which other Study 1 part I want you to present from the list above. 
5. Then you will present them to me. The things you should present for each analysis are:
    - The research question you are answering
    - Which variables you studied in this analysis
    - Which method you thought was appropriate to use in this analysis and why (with demonstrations of your checks of assumptions, etc. Show and describe a plot here.)
    - Your conclusions, including any estimates you made (with CIs if appropriate.)
6. If you have a partner, one of you will present the first analysis and the other will present the second analysis of your Study 1. I will tell you who will go first.

**Study 2 (10-12 minutes)**

7. I will move you on to the study 2 presentation. To present study 2, I want you to:
    - Tell me what your research question is and why it is interesting/important.
    - Tell me what your better model (the one you wound up with) has to say about the research question, to include: 
    - Specifying the outcome under study and whether you decided to transform it
    - Specifying the predictors (including the key predictor) in your model
    - Showing the coefficients (ideally tidied) of your equation, and describing the relationship between the key predictor and your outcome by interpreting its slope and CI.
    - Specifying the quality of fit for your model (a validated R-square is best - be sure that you back out of any transformation properly and can show that you did.)
    - Showing your residual plots and telling me what they tell you about the assumptions of your model.
    - Your conclusions about rational next steps to learn more from the data, or what specific new data you now wish you’d had when you started the study.
8. If you have a partner, one person will speak about the research question, model, outcome, predictors and coefficients while the other will talk about quality of fit, residual plots and rational next steps. I will usually let you decide which of you will do which part of Study 2.
9. I will then ask you questions about what you did in Study 2, and why you did it. You may have to dive into your HTML to find those answers. Prepare as needed to make this a quick process.
10. I will then ask you if you have any questions about Study 1 or Study 2 - it is fine to have some questions you want to ask at this stage, and it really helps if you’ve written them down.

At the end (and as we go) I will give you a little feedback on how I thought it went, and tell you about things I would suggest or require you to work on before submitting the final materials. 

Please remember to do the CWRU Course Evaluation when they ask you to do it, and to submit all of your Project B materials (Qmd, HTML and data if not NHANES) to Canvas and complete the self-evaluation by 9 AM on Sunday 2023-12-17. Otherwise, I'll have to give you an incomplete grade in the course.

Thanks and good luck!
