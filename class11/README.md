2. Lab 3 grades and feedback for Questions 1-6 are now posted to our 431 Grades Roster for Students on our Shared Drive. Please take a look.
    - I also revised the Answer Sketch for Lab 3, Question 5 to incorporate information on how I identified where Cuyahoga County's results fell on the plot. You'll also find this revised sketch on our Shared Drive's Lab Answer Sketches folder.

## Regarding Quiz 1

Final materials for [Quiz 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-quizzes-2023) will be made available to you **this Thursday 2023-10-05 at 5 PM**.

- All links to Quiz 1 materials will be found at <https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-quizzes-2023/tree/main/quiz1> as they become available.
- I will share a **draft** of the Instructions for Quiz 1 (no questions, just the general instructions) by **class time today**.
- Quiz 1 is due at noon on Tuesday 2023-10-10, and you will submit your results using the Google Form Answer Sheet I will provide on Thursday.
- Fair materials for Quiz 1 include the following (which doesn't mean I'll hit all of these things)...
    - [Classes](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2023/tree/main) 1-12, including the Slides and the READMEs,
    - our [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/) (all of Part A, and the little bit of Part B that is also covered in classes 1-12),
    - Spiegelhalter's *Art of Statistics* through Chapter 6,
    - [R4DS](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) Sections 1-12, 
    - [Labs](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2023) 1-3,
    - our [Minute Papers](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-minute-2023) after classes 3, 5, 9 and 11,
    - our [Favorite Movies work](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2023/tree/main/movies) through Class 10, and
    - the Data and Proposal parts of [Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/).

## Regarding Project A

Current Status of Project A Proposal Review is summarized [at this link](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2023/blob/main/projA/projectA_proposal.md).

- Remember that the Project A Checklist found on our Shared Drive includes the 17 things we're looking for in these reviews.
- You will get a response from Dr. Love in your email **tonight** if you submitted the work on time but there is an obvious issue with Things 1, 2, or 3 in your submission.
    - If this happens, we will stop reviewing your work there, and we will expect your revision (related to Things 1-3) by **9 AM Thursday 2023-10-05**.
    - If you don't hear from me tonight, it means we're satisfied enough with Things 1-3 that we'll go ahead and review your entire submitted proposal for Things 4-17.
- Our aim is to have a response to all of you regarding Things 1-17 no later than 5 PM Friday 2023-10-06.
    - Since you'll be doing Quiz 1 at that time, if you receive an email from Dr. Love after the Quiz is out stating that a further revision of your proposal is required before we can approve it, then that revision will be due at 9 AM on Thursday 2023-10-12.
