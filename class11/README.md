## Announcements

1. There is a [Minute Paper after Class 11](https://bit.ly/431-2023-minute-11), due tomorrow (Wednesday) at noon. The link is <https://bit.ly/431-2023-minute-11>.
2. Lab 3 grades and feedback for Questions 1-6 are now posted to our 431 Grades Roster for Students on our Shared Drive. Please take a look.
    - I also revised the Answer Sketch for Lab 3, Question 5 to incorporate information on how I identified where Cuyahoga County's results fell on the plot. You'll also find this revised sketch on our Shared Drive's Lab Answer Sketches folder.
3. Part B of [our Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/) (Chapters 18-28) is now posted.

## Regarding Quiz 1

Complete materials for [Quiz 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-quizzes-2023/tree/main/quiz1) will be available to you **this Thursday 2023-10-05 at 5 PM**.

- Quiz 1 materials will be linked at <https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-quizzes-2023/tree/main/quiz1> as they become available.
    - Some things are already posted there, so we'll take a look.
- Quiz 1 is due at **noon on Tuesday 2023-10-10**. Submit your responses using the Google Form Answer Sheet I'll provide Thursday.

## Regarding Project A

Current Status of Project A Proposal Review is summarized [at this link](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2023/blob/main/projA/projectA_proposal.md).

- Remember that the Project A Checklist found on our Shared Drive includes 17 things (labeled Thing 1 - Thing 17) that we're looking for in these reviews.
- You will get a response from Dr. Love in your email **no later than tonight** if you submitted the work on time but there is an obvious issue with Things 1, 2, or 3 in your submission.
    - If this happens, we will stop reviewing your work there, and we will specify a time by which you need to submit a revision.
    - If you don't hear from me tonight, it means we're satisfied enough with Things 1-3 that we'll go ahead and review your entire submitted proposal for Things 4-17.
- Our aim is to have a response to all of you regarding Things 1-17 no later than 5 PM Friday 2023-10-06.
    - Since you'll be doing Quiz 1 at that time, if you receive an email from Dr. Love after the Quiz is out stating that a further revision of your proposal is required before we can approve it, then that revision will be due after the Quiz deadline.

## One Last Thing

Student membership in the American Statistical Association is open to anyone in a degree program and costs just $25 per year.
