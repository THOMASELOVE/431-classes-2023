## Announcements

1. **Lab 1 feedback and grades** You should have received three emails from me yesterday between 4 and 6 PM, with the following subject headings. Please read them carefully.
    - `431 Students: Details on obtaining your Lab Code and Grade/Comments on Lab 1` which tells you about the 431 Grades Roster for Students in our Shared Drive
    - `431 Lab Code` which contains your Lab Code, which you need to find your grades and feedback on the 431 Grades Roster for Students.
    - `431 Lab 01: more important information and additional feedback` which includes information about several things now available to you, including the introductory videos from Question 1, and two sample essays from Questions 3 and 4.
    - A gentle reminder to [visit this part of our Labs page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2023#lab-regrade-requests-will-be-reviewed-in-december) if you want a regrade on a Lab.
2. **Minute Paper?** There is no Minute Paper this week.
3. **Lab 2** The TAs will inform you by noon Wednesday if they spot a major issue with your Lab 2 submission, which was due today at noon. A major issue means usually that your Quarto file and/or your HTML file is missing from your Canvas submission, or that your HTML file doesn't render properly (usually because you've left out `embed-resources: true` in your YAML. Dr. Love will post his answer sketch for Lab 2 to our Shared Drive by class time Thursday.

## Materials for Today's Class

We'll be working with a new data set, called `dm_1000.csv` today. The Class 07 slides posted above cover the material I didn't get to in the Class 06 slides, but now using these data instead of the `dm431.csv` data, and they also cover other issues. The `dm_1000.csv` data can be found on [our 431-data page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data/tree/main/data-and-code), or [in the `data` subfolder on this page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2023/blob/main/class07/data/dm_1000.csv).

## What's Coming Up?

- [Lab 3](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2023/tree/main#main-lab-instructions) is due next Tuesday 2023-09-26 at noon. By then, we'll want you to have read through Chapter 5 of *The Art of Statistics* (warning: Chapter 5 is a tricky one), and through Sections 1-7 and 10-12 of [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)
- Your [Project A proposal](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/) (for which you'll need to have completed the [Data](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/data.html) and [Proposal](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/proposal.html) activities) is due two weeks from today, on Tuesday 2023-10-03 at noon. I hope you've gotten started already on this. It's a substantial undertaking.
- We'll discuss your Favorite Movies again on Thursday this week. The current version of the list (movies_2023-09-14) is posted to our Shared Drive in the Favorite Movies folder.

## One Last Thing
