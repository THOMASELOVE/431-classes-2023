## Announcements

1. 
2. **Lab 1 feedback and grades** You should have received three emails from me yesterday between 4 and 6 PM, with the following subject headings. Please read them carefully.
    - `431 Students: Details on obtaining your Lab Code and Grade/Comments on Lab 1` which tells you about the 431 Grades Roster for Students in our Shared Drive
    - `431 Lab Code` which contains your Lab Code, which you need to find your grades and feedback on the 431 Grades Roster for Students.
    - `431 Lab 01: more important information and additional feedback` which includes information about several things now available to you, including the introductory videos from Question 1, and two sample essays from Questions 3 and 4.
    - A gentle reminder to [visit this part of our Labs page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2023#lab-regrade-requests-will-be-reviewed-in-december) if you want a regrade on a Lab.
3. **Minute Paper?** There is no Minute Paper this week.
4. **Lab 2** The TAs will inform you by noon Wednesday if they spot a major issue with your Lab 2 submission, which was due today at noon. A major issue means usually that your Quarto file and/or your HTML file is missing from your Canvas submission, or that your HTML file doesn't render properly (usually because you've left out `embed-resources: true` in your YAML. Dr. Love will post his answer sketch for Lab 2 to our Shared Drive by class time Thursday.

## One Last Thing

Today is, indeed, [an R User's favorite holiday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Talk_Like_a_Pirate_Day).
