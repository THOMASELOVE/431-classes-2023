## Announcements

1. **Lab 1 feedback and grades** You should have received three emails from me yesterday between 4 and 6 PM, with the following subject headings. Please read them carefully.
    - `431 Students: Details on obtaining your Lab Code and Grade/Comments on Lab 1` which tells you about the 431 Grades Roster for Students in our Shared Drive
    - `431 Lab Code` which contains your Lab Code, which you need to find your grades and feedback on the 431 Grades Roster for Students.
    - `431 Lab 01: more important information and additional feedback` which includes information about several things now available to you, including the introductory videos from Question 1, and two sample essays from Questions 3 and 4.
    - A gentle reminder to [visit this part of our Labs page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2023#lab-regrade-requests-will-be-reviewed-in-december) if you want a regrade on a Lab.

2. **Minute Paper?** There is no Minute Paper this week.

3. **Lab 2** The TAs will inform you by noon Wednesday if they spot a major issue with your Lab 2 submission, which was due today at noon. A major issue means usually that your Quarto file and/or your HTML file is missing from your Canvas submission, or that your HTML file doesn't render properly (usually because you've left out `embed-resources: true` in your YAML.) Dr. Love will post his answer sketch for Lab 2 to our Shared Drive by class time Thursday.

4. **Getting Help** The best ways to get help are:
    1. to visit TA office hours, which are held every day, including weekends.
    2. to pose a question on Campuswire, which Dr. Love and the TAs (at least) will see automatically.

If you are having trouble getting R to do what you expect it to do, you will need to include a Quarto file in your question here, so we can try to duplicate and then fix your problem. When submitting a Quarto file to Campuswire related to a Lab or other assignment, please select (using the blue button for posting) to post to instructors and TAs only, so that we can see what you've done, but your fellow students cannot. In responding to your question, we'll adjust it so that you and everyone can see your question and answer without seeing all of your code. Please indicate Campuswire posts that are helpful to you when you view them by clicking the up arrow next to those posts.

5. **When should I email Dr. Love?**
    - When you are responding to an email he sent you.
    - When you have a personal problem that requires you to pause the course.
    - When you are going to miss more than two classes in a row.
    - When you want to ask him or tell him about something personal to you, that *isn't* directly related to how to use R or statistics to do something in a course assignment.

## Materials for Today's Class

We'll be working with a new data set, called `dm_1000.csv` today. The Class 07 slides posted above cover the material I didn't get to in the Class 06 slides, but now using these data instead of the `dm431.csv` data, and they also cover other issues. The `dm_1000.csv` data can be found on [our 431-data page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data/tree/main/data-and-code), or [in the `data` subfolder on this page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2023/blob/main/class07/data/dm_1000.csv).

## What's Coming Up?

- [Lab 3](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2023/tree/main#main-lab-instructions) is due next Tuesday 2023-09-26 at noon. By then, we'll want you to have read through Chapter 5 of *The Art of Statistics* (warning: Chapter 5 is a tricky one), and through Sections 1-7 and 10-12 of [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)
- Your [Project A proposal](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/) (for which you'll need to have completed the [Data](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/data.html) and [Proposal](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/proposal.html) activities) is due two weeks from today, on Tuesday 2023-10-03 at noon. I hope you've gotten started already on this. It's a substantial undertaking.
- We'll discuss your Favorite Movies again on Thursday this week. The current version of the list (movies_2023-09-14) is posted to our Shared Drive in the Favorite Movies folder.

## One Last Thing

Today is [an R User's favorite holiday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Talk_Like_a_Pirate_Day).
