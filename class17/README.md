## Announcements

1. Here is a nice [Editorial by Jeff Witmer](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10691898.2019.1702415) (from Oberlin College) at the *Journal of Statistics Education* which is *a position paper on the use of p-values, statistical inference, terminology, and related ideas*. I got a lot out of it, and there's a lot here related to our discussion in Class 16.

## One Last Thing: On Managing an R Project

Jenny Bryan is the main person I listen to on these and many other issues. Consider:

- [How To Name Files](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files)
- [Project-oriented workflow](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/) at tidyverse.org from Jenny Bryan.
    - or try [A Project-Oriented Workflow](https://whattheyforgot.org/project-oriented-workflow.html) from [What They Forgot to Teach You About R](https://whattheyforgot.org/) by Jenny Bryan and Jim Hester.
- [STAT 545](https://stat545.com/r-basics.html) includes an outstanding set of resources to help you work better in R, and do more effective data analysis.
