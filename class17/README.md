## Announcements

1. Here is a nice [Editorial by Jeff Witmer](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10691898.2019.1702415) (from Oberlin College) at the *Journal of Statistics Education* which is *a position paper on the use of p-values, statistical inference, terminology, and related ideas*. I got a lot out of it, and there's a lot here related to our discussion in Class 16.
2. We have posted some of the responses to [Lab 3](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2023) Question 6 that we liked to our Shared Drive in the Lab Answer Sketches folder.
3. We have posted grades and feedback (this time from the TAs and Dr. Love) for [Lab 4](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2023) to the 431 Grades Roster, and we also posted two of the better responses for Lab 4 Questions 1-4 to our Shared Drive (again in the Lab Answer Sketches folder.)
4. We will post an Answer Sketch for [Lab 5](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2023) on Saturday 2023-10-28 by noon.
5. We went through the Movies [Breakout 2 activity](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2023/blob/main/movies/breakout2.md) last week, and the [results of that work are available here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2023/blob/main/movies/breakout2_results.md).
    - Breakout 2 led to my creation of a [new Google Sheet called `movies_2023-10-24`](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2023/tree/main/movies#new-data-set-movies_2023-10-24), which is available on our Shared Drive.
    - For our 201 movies, the new version now includes **90** variables, vs. the 22 in the `movies_2023-09-14` data.
    - At least one more Breakout session is coming soon.
6. No Minute Paper this week.

## Project A is due Tuesday at Noon.

Your final [Project A Portfolio](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/portfolio.html) is due to Canvas at **noon** on **Tuesday 2023-10-31**.

1. Please submit the four files (`qmd`, `rds`, `HTML` and video (`mp4`)) together to the Project A Portfolio assignment on [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu).
    - Try to avoid submitting anything other than those four files, and if you have to resubmit one thing, resubmit all four at once.
    - If you have a partner, one of you must submit the one-pager stating who your partner is and that they will submit the materials, while the other submits the four files.
2. Your [highlight video](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/portfolio.html#the-highlight-video) should be a maximum of 3 minutes. That will be hard to do. Read the instructions carefully.
    - If your submitted video is over 3 minutes and 10 seconds, you are risking a substantial penalty.
3. Do not forget to complete the [Self-Evaluation form](https://bit.ly/431-projectA-self-evaluation-2023).
    - If you have a partner, **each** of you must complete this form separately.
4. I posted the [dates and sources for variables in Analysis 3 that come from CHR 2018](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/data.html#data-task-5.-add-2018-data-for-your-analysis-3-outcome) to the Project A Data page on Sunday 2023-10-22. Please get this information into your Codebook (Section 11.)

## One Last Thing: On Managing an R Project

Jenny Bryan is the main person I listen to on these and many other issues. Consider:

- [How To Name Files](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files)
- [Project-oriented workflow](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/) at tidyverse.org from Jenny Bryan.
    - or try [A Project-Oriented Workflow](https://whattheyforgot.org/project-oriented-workflow.html) from [What They Forgot to Teach You About R](https://whattheyforgot.org/) by Jenny Bryan and Jim Hester.
- [STAT 545](https://stat545.com/r-basics.html) includes an outstanding set of resources to help you work better in R, and do more effective data analysis.
