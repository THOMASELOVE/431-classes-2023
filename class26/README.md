2. Feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 25 should also be available **by class time**.
3. [The `ggmice` package](https://amices.org/ggmice/ind) can help you enhance your multiple imputation work with visualizations for incomplete or imputed data. I'll try to get some material about it into 432.

## Remaining Deliverables

1. If you want Dr. Love to [regrade any of your Lab work](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2023#lab-regrade-requests-will-be-reviewed-in-december), visit <https://bit.ly/431-lab-regrade-form-2023> by Friday 2023-12-08 at noon.
2. Optional [Lab X](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-labX/) is due at noon on 2023-12-12.
    - Here are [the success stories to date](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2023/tree/main/labX). Congratulations to all of you!
3. Here is the [Project B Schedule of Presentations](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2023/blob/main/projB/schedule.md).
    - Plan to join the Zoom call (or arrive at my office) five minutes before your presentation begins. Zoom information is found [on our Shared Drive in the Project B Presentations: Zoom Information document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ARSzHgUeoPW45ljzvecc46pHzUEQvjpDARB0a4-5418/edit?usp=sharing). 
    - Come to your presentation with a completed Project B. All of my other advice for the presentation [is available here](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2023/checklist.html#oral-presentation-of-results).
    - There is no need to post anything to Canvas about Project B before giving your presentation.
    - Zoom information for each day of presentations will be made available to you via email **by class time today**.
4. All [Project B](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2023/) materials (Quarto, HTML, Data and Self-Evaluation) are due at **9 AM on Sunday 2023-12-17**.
    - No late work will be accepted after 9 AM Sunday 2023-12-17.
    - If you are working with a partner, one of you should submit both the Study 1 and Study 2 reports to Canvas, and the other person should submit a one-page note to Canvas (word or PDF is best) containing your name, and stating something like “I worked on Project B with [your partner’s name] and they will submit Project B for our group.”
    - A complete set of Project B materials includes:
        1. your Quarto report for Study 1 (.qmd and .html) submitted to Canvas. Be sure that the names of your Quarto and HTML files clearly identify whose project is being submitted and that these items refer to study 1.
        2. your Quarto report for Study 2 (.qmd and .html) submitted to Canvas. Be sure that the names of your Quarto and HTML files clearly identify whose project is being submitted and that these items refer to study 2.
        3. if you worked with any data other than NHANES, your submission also needs to include your data (in the form you used to ingest the data in your Quarto file(s), so that we can run your Quarto code and obtain your HTML results.)
        4. and finally, the self-evaluation form at <https://bit.ly/431-2023-projectB-self-evaluation>, which you (and your partner, if you have one) should do separately once you've submitted your materials to Canvas.
        5. You are welcome to, but *not required to*, also post your slides (if you used them) from your presentation.



## One Last Thing

Frank Harrell posted this [Biostatistical Modeling Plan](https://hbiostat.org/blog/post/modplan/), most recently on 2023-01-26. This is the kind of thing we will work towards in 432.

> This is an example statistical plan for project proposals where the goal is to develop a biostatistical model for prediction, and to do external or strong internal validation of the model.
