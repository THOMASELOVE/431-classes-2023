## Announcements

1. The Project B Schedule of Presentations [is available here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2023/blob/main/projB/schedule.md). Plan to join the Zoom call (or arrive at my office) five minutes before your presentation begins.
2. Grades and an answer sketch for Quiz 2 should be in your hands **before class time**.
3. [The `ggmice` package](https://amices.org/ggmice/ind) can help you enhance your multiple imputation work with visualizations for incomplete or imputed data. I'll try to get some material about it into 432.

## One Last Thing

Frank Harrell posted this [Biostatistical Modeling Plan](https://hbiostat.org/blog/post/modplan/), most recently on 2023-01-26. This is the kind of thing we will work towards in 432.

> This is an example statistical plan for project proposals where the goal is to develop a biostatistical model for prediction, and to do external or strong internal validation of the model.
