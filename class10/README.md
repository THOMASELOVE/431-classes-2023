## Announcements

1. The Lab 3 Answer Sketch will be posted to our Shared Drive **by class time**.
    - I sent out Lab 3 Question 7 feedback and grades via email on Wednesday 2023-09-27. Email me if you didn't get this information.
2. I've identified four essays we liked in response to Lab 2 Question 8, and shared them in our Shared Drive.
    - You'll find them in the Lab Answer Sketches folder.
3. Feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 9 will be posted **by class time**.
4. A description of the **17** item Proposal Checklist that you should check before submitting your Project A is **now available**.
    - You'll find it in our Shared Drive in the **Project A Proposal Materials** folder.
    - This is how the TAs and I will be evaluating your proposals. Nothing in this document should come as a surprise if you've read the instructions and used the template and sample project proposal.
    - I also revised the Project A Proposal Template and Sample Project A Proposal on Wednesday at 2 PM to include the distinct values check and missingness check in Section 11. You'll find all the relevant files (qmd and html) in our Shared Drive in the **Project A Proposal Materials** folder. (I just had the labels backwards.)
