## Announcements

1. The Lab 3 Answer Sketch will be posted to our Shared Drive **by class time**.
    - I sent out Lab 3 Question 7 feedback and grades via email on Wednesday 2023-09-27. Email me if you didn't get this information.
2. I've identified four essays we liked in response to Lab 2 Question 8, and shared them in our Shared Drive.
    - You'll find them in the Lab Answer Sketches folder.
3. Feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 9 is now available at <https://bit.ly/431-2023-min-09-feedback>.
    - The Course Grades Roster on our Shared Drive has grades on Labs 1 and 2, as well as the Minute Papers.
4. The **17** item Proposal Checklist that you should check before submitting your Project A [is now available](https://bit.ly/431-2023-projectA-proposal-checklist).
    - You'll find it in our Shared Drive in the **Project A Proposal Materials** folder, or visit <https://bit.ly/431-2023-projectA-proposal-checklist>.
    - This is how the TAs and I will be evaluating your proposals.
    - Nothing in this document should come as a surprise if you've read the [Project A instructions](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/) and used the [Project A Proposal Template](https://rpubs.com/TELOVE/projectA-proposal-template) and [Sample Project Proposal](https://rpubs.com/TELOVE/projectA-sample-proposal).
    - I also slightly revised the Project A Proposal Template and Sample Project A Proposal on Wednesday at 2 PM to include the distinct values check and missingness check in Section 11.
        - You'll find all the relevant files (qmd and html) in [our Shared Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Az0_5kBEaugxGZ-OcSJ78NRDgDOektPf/view?usp=drive_link) in the **Project A Proposal Materials** folder.
        - The only change I made was to put the Missingness label on the missingness check and the Distinct Values label on the distinct values check. I'd mixed them up in the earlier version.
