Be sure to get one of the "A Convenient Piece of Paper" handouts. Don't write on it yet. Instead, get to know those around you.

Each class' README serves as a starting point for that class session.
The main website for this class is https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2023/. From that site, get to this README by

## Announcements

1. Thank you to those of you who've completed the [Welcome to 431 Survey](https://bit.ly/431-2023-welcome-survey) (35 of you as of 11:30 PM Monday.) 
    - If you haven't completed this yet, please do so today. 
    - Dr. Love will discuss the Survey results once they are complete. 
        - For now, I'll agree that there's a lot of work in this course, but your predecessors have found it rewarding.
    - If you are **not yet enrolled** in this class, please talk to me before you leave this room. 
        - We're full here, but there is a Section 2 of 431 from 4:00 - 5:15 on Tuesdays and Thursdays. 

2. As part of our slides today, we'll visit [the main course page](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2023/) for the course, and look over:

- the [Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-syllabus-2023/)
- the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/) (main text for the course)
- the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2023/calendar.html), which is the final word for all deadlines in this course
- the [Assignments](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2023/assignments.html), including the [first Lab](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2023)
- the information available on [getting R and R Studio](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2023/software.html#installing-r-and-r-studio) and some [R packages and data sets](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2023/software.html#installing-r-packages-and-datacode-for-431) installed on your computer. You will need administrator authority on your computer to get this done.
- the [Campuswire discussion forum](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2023/campuswire.html) for the class, and other [ways you can get help from us](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2023/contact.html).
    - [Campuswire](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2023/campuswire.html) is the best place to ask (and answer) questions outside of class time.
    - It's also where I'll post key information between classes, so sign up today!
- TA Office Hours will begin on Tuesday 2023-09-05. All are held via Zoom.
    - The schedule is available on our [Contact Us](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2023/contact.html) and [Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2023/calendar.html) pages, while the Zoom links are in a document on our Shared Google Drive.
    - Find the shared drive listed as **431 Fall 2023 Dr Love and Students** on your CWRU Google Drive.
- the [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/) page for the course, which we use only as a place to turn in some assignments.

3. Posit (makers of RStudio) publish [incredibly useful Cheat Sheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/), which are a great source of help, too.

## Ten Things To Do After Class 01 (if you haven't, already)

1. Bookmark and familiarize yourself with the [main course website](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2023/), being sure to visit the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2023/calendar.html) and see what's ahead of you.
2. Read through the [Course Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-syllabus-2023/).
3. Obtain David Spiegelhalter's *The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data* (~$20), and read the Introduction and Chapter 1.
    - Our [Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2023/calendar.html) provides reading deadlines. Try to keep up.
4. Complete the [Welcome to 431 survey](https://bit.ly/431-2023-welcome-survey), if you haven't yet. Thanks if you've already done this.
5. Get started [installing the software](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2023/software.html) you'll need.
6. Sign up for the (free) [Campuswire discussion forum](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2023/campuswire.html) and ask a question or leave a comment.
7. Take a look at the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/). Part A is now a complete version.
8. You should also bookmark [R for Data Science, 2nd ed.](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), the [R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org/), and perhaps [OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/book/os/). Each of these books is very useful. I would also bookmark the [Posit Cheat Sheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/) page.
9. Ask us questions. TA office hours start next Tuesday, but [Campuswire is available now](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2023/campuswire.html).
10. Take a look at [Lab 01 (due 2023-09-12 at noon)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2023) which is your first substantial deliverable.
