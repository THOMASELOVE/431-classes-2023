## As you walk in...
Be sure to get one of the "A Convenient Piece of Paper" handouts. Don't write on it yet. Instead, get to know those around you.

Each class' README serves as a starting point for that class session.
The main website for this class is https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2023/. From that site, get to this README by

## Announcements

1. Thank you to the 48 of you who've completed the [Welcome to 431 Survey](https://bit.ly/431-2022-welcome-survey) (as of 12:49 PM today.) 
    - If you are one of the 12 enrolled students who hasn't completed this yet, please do so today. 
    - Dr. Love will discuss the Survey results once they are complete. 
        - For now, I'll agree that there's a lot of work in this course, but your predecessors have found it rewarding.
    - If you are **not yet enrolled** in this class, please talk to me before you leave this room. 
        - We're (more than) full here, but there is a Section 2 of 431 from 4:00 - 5:15 on Tuesdays and Thursdays. 

2. As part of our slides today, we'll visit [the main course page](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2023/) for the course, and look over:

- the [Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-syllabus-2022/)
- the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/) (main text for the course)
- the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/calendar.html), which is the final word for all deadlines in this course
- the [Assignments](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/assignments.html), including the [first Lab](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2022)
- the information available on [getting R and R Studio](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/software.html#installing-r-and-r-studio) and some [R packages and data sets](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/software.html#installing-r-packages-and-datacode-for-431) installed on your computer.
- the [Campuswire discussion forum](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/campuswire.html) for the class, and other [ways you can get help from us](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/contact.html)
    - [Campuswire](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/campuswire.html) is the best place to ask (and answer) questions outside of class time.
    - It's also where I'll post key information between classes, like how to access the class recordings, so sign up today!
    - TA Office Hours will begin on Tuesday 2022-09-06. All are held via Zoom. We'll get a schedule to you as soon as possible.
- the [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/) page for the course, which we use only as a place to turn in some assignments.
- the Shared Google Drive for the course, which you should find listed as **431 Fall 2022 Dr Love and Students** on your CWRU Google Drive. At the moment, it contains nothing of particular importance, but that will change.

3. RStudio's [incredibly useful Cheat Sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) are a great source of help, too.

## Ten Things To Do After Class 01 (if you haven't, already)

1. Bookmark and familiarize yourself with the [main course website](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/), being sure to visit the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/calendar.html) and see what's ahead of you.
2. Read through the [Course Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-syllabus-2022/).
3. Obtain David Spiegelhalter's *The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data* (~$20), and read the Introduction.
    - Our [Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/calendar.html) provides reading lists on weekends, anticipating that you'll complete the suggested reading before the next class.
4. Complete the [Welcome to 431 survey](https://bit.ly/431-2022-welcome-survey), if you haven't yet. Thanks if you've already done this.
5. Get started [installing the software](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/software.html) you'll need.
6. Sign up for the (free) [Campuswire discussion forum](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/campuswire.html).
7. Take a look at the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/). Part A is now a complete version.
8. You should also bookmark [Introduction to Modern Statistics](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/) and [R for Data Science, 2nd ed.](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/). Each of these books is very useful. I would also bookmark the [RStudio Cheat Sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) page.
9. Ask us questions. TA office hours start next Tuesday, but [Campuswire is available now](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/campuswire.html).
10. Take a look at [Lab 01 (due 2022-09-12)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2022) which is your first substantial deliverable.
