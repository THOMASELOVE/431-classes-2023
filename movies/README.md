# Favorite Movies

On our Shared Google Drive in the `Favorite Movies` subfolder, you'll find a data set (a Google Sheet called `movies_2023-09-14`) containing 201 films that people taking either the 2020, 2021, 2022 or 2023 versions of 431 identified as their "Favorite Movies". 

For each movie, I gathered several characteristics from the [Internet Movie Data Base](https://www.imdb.com/) (IMDB), as well as two characteristics from the [Rotton Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/) website.

## Breakout Session 1

- Here's our [first breakout activity](breakout1.md), which we will go through in Class 08 (2023-09-21).
- Here are some [results of that first breakout activity](breakout1_results.md), which we will discuss in Class 09 (2023-09-26).

## Sample Analyses related to Project A

- These Analyses are discussed briefly in Class 14 (2023-10-12).
- Sample Analysis 1 (simple regression): [View Analysis 1 HTML](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/431-movies-analysis1.html), and [Download Analysis 1 code (qmd)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data/main/data-and-code/431-movies-analysis1.qmd)
- Sample Analysis 2 (independent samples): [View Analysis 2 HTML](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/431-movies-analysis2.html), and [Download Analysis 2 code (qmd)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data/main/data-and-code/431-movies-analysis2.qmd)

## Breakout Session 2

- Here's our [second breakout activity](breakout2.md), which we completed in Class 16 (2023-10-19).
- Here are some [results of that second breakout activity](breakout2_results.md), which we will discuss in Class 17 (2023-10-26).

## New Data Set: `movies_2023-10-24`

Breakout 2 led to my creation of a **new Google Sheet** called `movies_2023-10-24`, which is available on our Shared Drive. 

- This data set includes 90 variables for each of the 201 movies on our list.
- The Google Sheet has two tabs: **Data_90vars**, which contains the data on each movie, and **Codebook_90vars**, which contains:
    - The column and number of each of the 90 variables for identification
    - The name and the description of each variable
    - The source of each variable
    - The type of variable (id, integer, count, factor, character, decimal, link)
    - The number of missing values (out of the 201 movies)
    - for quantities: the minimum, median, maximum, mean and standard deviation of the values

## Session 3: Model Building and Multiple Imputation

Here's an outline of what we'll do in our [third movie session](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2023/blob/main/movies/session3.md) during [Class 25](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2023/tree/main/class25) (2023-12-05)
