# Favorite Movies

On our Shared Google Drive in the `Favorite Movies` subfolder, you'll find a data set (a Google Sheet called `movies_2023-09-14`) containing 201 films that people taking either the 2020, 2021, 2022 or 2023 versions of 431 identified as their "Favorite Movies". 

For each movie, I gathered several additional characteristics from the [Internet Movie Data Base](https://www.imdb.com/) (IMDB).
