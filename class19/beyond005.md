# Beyond "p < 0.05"

Ten days ago, I posted a note (called "Bonus Opportunity") on Campuswire. It read: 

> Post your favorite sentence from the [2019 ASA statement](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2019.1583913) in a response to this note by Thursday 2023-11-02 at 9 AM.
>
> (1) If you see that someone else has selected your sentence, give their response a thumbs up and then post a different sentence that hasn't been posted already.
> (2) If you like a sentence someone has posted here, give it a thumbs up.
> (3) I won't be reminding people about this in class, even though I'd love to see you all respond to this.

The 2019 ASA Statement citation is: Ronald L. Wasserstein, Allen L. Schirm & Nicole A. Lazar (2019) [Moving to a World Beyond "p < 0.05"](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2019.1583913) *The American Statistician*, 73:sup1, 1-19, [DOI: 10.1080/00031305.2019.1583913](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2019.1583913).

Here are the excerpts you posted:

1. Statistical significance was never meant to imply scientific importance.
2. Evaluate the importance of statistical results based on their practical implications.
3. Statistical methods do not rid data of their uncertainty.
4. We can learn much (indeed, more) about the world by forsaking the false promise of certainty offered by dichotomous declarations of truth or falsity—binary statements about there being "an effect" or "no effect" - based on some *p*-value or other statistical threshold being attained.
5. Statistics is often sold as a sort of alchemy that transmutes randomness into certainty, an "uncertainty laundering" that begins with data and concludes with success as measured by statistical significance.
6. In this world, where studies with "*p* < 0.05" and studies with "*p* > 0.05" are not automatically in conflict, researchers will see their results more easily replicated - and, even when not, they will better understand why.
7. Accept uncertainty. Be thoughtful, open, and modest. Remember "ATOM."
8. Don't conclude anything about scientific or practical importance based on statistical significance (or lack thereof).
9. Don't base your conclusions solely on whether an association or effect was found to be "statistically significant."
10. Don't believe that an association or effect is absent just because it was not statistically significant.
11. Don't believe that an association or effect exists just because it was statistically significant
12. Don't believe that your *p*-value gives the probability that chance alone produced the observed association or effect or the probability that your test hypothesis is true.
13. *P*-values do not measure the probability that the studied hypothesis is true, or the probability that the data were produced by random chance alone.
14. Despite the limitations of *p*-values (as noted in Principles 5 and 6 of the ASA statement), however, we are not recommending that the calculation and use of continuous p-values be discontinued. Where p-values are used, they should be reported as continuous quantities (e.g., *p* = 0.08).
15. We must accept that there is subjectivity in every stage of scientific inquiry, but objectivity is nevertheless the fundamental goal. Therefore, we should base judgments on evidence and careful reasoning, and seek wherever possible to eliminate potential sources of bias.
16. Unfortunately, there is a long history of such statements appearing and having only transient impact, because an alternative to *p*-values is not specified.
17. No *p*-value can reveal the plausibility, presence, truth, or importance of an association or effect. Therefore, a label of statistical significance does not mean or imply that an association or effect is highly probable, real, true, or important. Nor does a label of statistical nonsignificance lead to the association or effect being improbable, absent, false, or unimportant.
18. As Gelman and Stern famously observed, the difference between "significant" and "not significant" is not itself statistically significant.
19. Thoughtful research prioritizes sound data production by putting energy into the careful planning, design, and execution of the study.
20. Regardless of whether it was ever useful, a declaration of "statistical significance" has today become meaningless.
21. The basic explanation is neither philosophical nor scientific, but sociologic; everyone uses them. It’s the same reason we can use money. When everyone believes in something’s value, we can use it for real things; money for food, and p-values for knowledge claims, publication, funding, and promotion. It doesn’t matter if the *p*-value doesn’t mean what people think it means; it becomes valuable because of what it buys.
22. Thoughtful research considers the scientific context and prior evidence. In this regard, a declaration of statistical significance is the antithesis of thoughtfulness: it says nothing about practical importance, and it ignores what previous studies have contributed to our knowledge.
23. Thoughtful research considers multiple approaches for solving problems.
24. Accepting uncertainty leads us to be thoughtful.
25. This is a world where researchers are free to treat "*p* = 0.051" and "*p* = 0.049" as not being categorically different, where authors no longer find themselves constrained to selectively publish their results based on a single magic number.
26. Openness also includes understanding and accepting the role of expert judgment, which enters the practice of statistical inference and decision-making in numerous ways.
27. In the real world, data provide a noisy signal. Variation, one of the causes of uncertainty, is everywhere. Exact replication is difficult to achieve. So it is time to get the right (statistical) gear and "move toward a greater acceptance of uncertainty and embracing of variation."
28. Judgment is necessarily subjective, but should be made as carefully, as objectively, and as scientifically as possible.
29. Researchers will be free to communicate all their findings in all their glorious uncertainty, knowing their work is to be judged by the quality and effective communication of their science, and not by their p-values.
30. In a world beyond "*p* < 0.05," by breaking free from the bonds of statistical significance, statistics in science and policy will become more significant than ever.
31. Moving beyond "statistically significant" opens researchers to the real significance of statistics, which is "the science of learning from data, and of measuring, controlling, and communicating uncertainty."
32. Quantify the uncertainty of your predictions.
33. Train graduate students and future researchers by having them reanalyze published studies and post their findings to appropriate websites or weblogs. This practice will benefit not only the students, but will benefit the professions, by increasing the amount of replicated (or nonreplicated) research available and readily accessible, and as well as reformer organizations that support replication.
34. ... statistically thoughtful researchers begin above all else with clearly expressed objectives. They recognize when they are doing exploratory studies and when they are doing more rigidly pre-planned studies.
