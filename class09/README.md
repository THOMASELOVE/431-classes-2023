## Announcements

1. There is a [Minute Paper after Class 9](https://bit.ly/431-2023-minute-9), due tomorrow (Wednesday 2023-09-27) at Noon. The link is <https://bit.ly/431-2023-minute-9>.
2. Grades and Feedback on Lab 2 are now available in the **431 Grades Roster** on our Shared Drive. Please review our comments there.
3. Now might be a good time to [update your R packages](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2023/software.html#updating-your-r-packages).
4. Remember that your [Project A proposal](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/) is due next Tuesday 2023-10-03 at noon.
    - We'll tell you more about how we'll grade those proposals in Class 10 on Thursday.
    - I want to be sure you're all aware of the [Project A Examples](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/examples.html).
5. Campuswire etiquette:
    - Please don't thank us for a useful answer. Just upvote it by clicking the up arrow next to the post.
    - If you have a question about a Lab that involves R, include the Quarto file, and post it *to the Instructors and TAs only*. Don't just post the error message, or just post a screen shot. By all means, post those things, but also attach your Quarto file. Otherwise, you are just wasting your time, and I hate when students' time is wasted.
    - Posts on Campuswire automatically appear in my email. No reason to send to both places.
 
## Materials for Today's Class

1. The `dm_1000.Rds` file and the `Love-boost.R` script are on [our 431-data page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data), and also in [the data subfolder on this page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2023/tree/main/class09/data).
2. The [kableExtra vignette is here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html) to learn more about building tables with these tools. Of course, we could also use [the gt package](https://gt.rstudio.com/) for these things.
3. [R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org/), (2nd Edition) by Winston Chang

## One Last Thing

Results of the Favorite Movies Breakout Activity from Class 08 [can be found here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2023/blob/main/movies/breakout1_results.md). 

We'll answer some of the questions you developed around these data, and address some common R and Quarto challenges, in Class 10 on Thursday.
