# Project A Portfolio Review Status

We aim to get your Project A feedback and grade to you on **2023-11-09 via email from Dr. Love**. 

**Note**: "Assessment" scores on Canvas are posted only to help us track reviews. Read our Canvas comments (if any) but ignore the score there.

### Stages of Review (TAs work on Forms 2-6, Dr. Love does the rest.)

- **Step 0**: We have received a **complete** Project A submission on Canvas (all four necessary files) *and* your HTML file is formatted properly, *and* if you have a partner, that partner has completed the one-page note. Partner who is *not submitting* the main materials is indicated in italics. *Also*, we have received a Self-Evaluation form from the investigator(s) and no critical responses are blank.
- **Form 1**: We have completed Form 1 (Initial Checks) of our evaluation, so that Forms 2-8 can now be completed.
- **Form 2**: Rds/qmd/video checks, **Form 3**: HTML checks, **Form 4**: Analysis 1 review, **Form 5**: Analysis 2 review, **Form 6**: Analysis 3 review
- **Form 7**: Dr. Love's review of the Video, **Form 8**: Dr. Love's review of the Self-Evaluation (*note*: I've scored these 7-10 instead of just 9-10.)
- **Ready**: Dr. Love is ready to aggregate the results, review the portfolio one last time, and write up your final feedback.
- **Complete**: All reviewing is complete, and Dr. Love has developed your final feedback document and assigned a grade for Project A.
