## One Last Thing

[Abandoning statistical significance is both sensible and practical](https://peerj.com/preprints/27657/), a pre-print letter to the JAMA editor from 2019 by Valentin Amrhein, Andrew Gelman, Sander Greenland, and  Blakeley B McShane may be of some interest to you.

Thanks for your patience with me as I get over this bug.
